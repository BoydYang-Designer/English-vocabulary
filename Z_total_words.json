It's derived from the winding course of the Meander River in Turkey, which twists and turns rather than flowing straight. So, when something meanders, it follows a winding or curving path, often without a clear destination or purpose. It can describe both physical movement, like a river meandering through a landscape, and metaphorical movement, such as thoughts or conversations that follow a winding or circuitous route.\n1.E.g.The trail meanders along the edge of the forest, leading us to a hidden lake.\n2.E.g.His conversation always meanders, making it hard to predict what he'll say next.",
