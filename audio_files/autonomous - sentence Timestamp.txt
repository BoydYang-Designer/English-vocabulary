[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960] Autonomous refers to the capability of acting independently or having
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.740] the freedom to make decisions without external control.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.580] In various contexts,
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.000] it can imply different degrees of independence, ranging from complete self -governance to partial
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.360] decision -making abilities.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.400] For instance, in robotics, autonomous robots can operate and make decisions without direct
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.340] human intervention.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.260] While in politics, an autonomous region has a certain level of self -governance within
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.560] a larger political entity.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.260] Examples.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.220] One, the autonomous car smoothly navigated through city traffic, adjusting its speed and direction
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.380] based on real -time sensor data and pre -programmed algorithms.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.520] Two,
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.160] the research team developed an autonomous drone capable of surveying remote landscapes and collecting
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.640] environmental data without the need for human guidance.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.500] Three,
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.960] the autonomous region gained increased authority over its economic policies, allowing
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.660] it to enact regulations and trade agreements independently from the central government.
