[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880] Autonomous refers to the capability of acting independently or having the freedom to make
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.720] decisions without external control.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.560] In various contexts, it can imply different degrees of independence ranging from complete
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.560] self-governance to partial decision-making abilities.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.480] For instance, in robotics, autonomous robots can operate and make decisions without direct
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.080] human intervention.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.320] While in politics, an autonomous region has a certain level of self-governance within
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.560] a larger political entity.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.560] Examples 1.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.360] The autonomous car smoothly navigated through city traffic, adjusting its speed and direction
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.200] based on real-time sensor data and pre-programmed algorithms.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.360] 2.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.640] The research team developed an autonomous drone capable of surveying remote landscapes
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.200] and collecting environmental data without the need for human guidance.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.400] 3.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.120] The autonomous region gained increased authority over its economic policies, allowing it
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.840] to enact regulations and trade agreements independently from the central government.
