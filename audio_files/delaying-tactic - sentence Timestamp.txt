[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440] A delaying tactic refers to any action or strategy employed to postpone or stall a process,
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.760] decision, or action.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.520] People might use delaying tactics for various reasons, such as gaining more time to prepare,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.780] avoiding a confrontation, or hoping that circumstances will change in their favor.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.920] In some cases, delaying tactics can be intentional and strategic, while in others, they might be
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000] more spontaneous reactions to unexpected situations.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.060] For example, the company's management employed a delaying tactic by promising to address
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.340] employee concerns in the next quarterly meeting, effectively post-poning any immediate action
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.840] on the matter.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.840] Example.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.740] The politician employed a delaying tactic by requesting additional time to review the
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.400] proposed legislation, knowing that it would buy them more time to gather support from
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.560] undecided colleagues.
