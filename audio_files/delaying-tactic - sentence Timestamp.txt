[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920] A delaying tactic refers to any action or strategy employed to postpone or stall
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.460] a process,
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.560] decision, or action.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.860] People might use delaying tactics for various reasons, such as gaining more time to prepare,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.280] avoiding a confrontation,
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.080] or hoping that circumstances will change in their favor.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.940] In some cases, delaying tactics can be intentional and strategic, while in others,
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.720] they might be more spontaneous reactions to unexpected situations.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.500] Example, the company's management employed a delaying tactic by promising to
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.480] address employee concerns in the next quarterly meeting, effectively postponing
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.860] any immediate action on the matter.
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.140] Example,
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.940] the politician employed a delaying tactic by requesting additional time to review the proposed legislation,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.300] knowing that it would buy them more time to gather support from undecided colleagues.
