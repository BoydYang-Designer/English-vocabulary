[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440] Vagnes refers to a lack of clarity or precision in language, thought, or concepts.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.720] When something is vague, it is not clearly defined or specified, making it difficult to understand
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.880] or interpret accurately.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.760] Vagnes can occur for various reasons, such as imprecise language, ambiguous descriptions,
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.520] or uncertain boundaries.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.400] It often leads to confusion or misunderstanding because the intended meaning is not sufficiently
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.440] clear or specific.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.160] For example, the dream had a sense of vagueness with fleeting images that were difficult
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.680] to grasp upon waking.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.920] The politician's speech was criticized for its vagueness as it lacked concrete plans
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.960] or solutions to address the pressing issues facing the country.
