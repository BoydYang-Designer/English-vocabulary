[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840] Vagueness refers to a lack of clarity or precision in language, thought,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.620] or concepts.
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.080] When something is vague, it is not clearly defined or specified, making it difficult to
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.760] understand or interpret accurately.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.180] Vagueness can occur for various reasons, such as imprecise language, ambiguous descriptions,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.800] or uncertain boundaries.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.240] It often leads to confusion or misunderstanding because the intended meaning is not sufficiently
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.260] clear or specific.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.160] For example, the dream had a sense of vagueness with fleeting images
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160] that were difficult to grasp upon waking.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.020] The politician's speech was criticized for its vagueness as it lacked concrete plans or
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.800] solutions to address the pressing issues facing the country.
