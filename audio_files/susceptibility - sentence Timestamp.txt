[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040] Susceptibility refers to the state of being easily influenced, affected, or harmed by something.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.640] It implies a vulnerability or tendency to be impacted by external factors, such as diseases,
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.240] environmental conditions, or emotional influences.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.200] When something or someone is susceptible to something, it means they are prone to experiencing
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.640] its effects more readily or intensely compared to others who may be less susceptible.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.280] For example, due to her weakened immune system, she has a higher susceptibility to catching
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.640] colds during the winter months. Another example is that children are often more susceptible to peer
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.600] pressure during their teenage years.
