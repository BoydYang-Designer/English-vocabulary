[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700] Susceptibility refers to the state of being easily influenced,
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.280] affected, or harmed by something.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.080] It implies a vulnerability or tendency to be impacted by external factors, such as diseases,
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.200] environmental conditions, or emotional influences.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.100] When something or someone is susceptible to something, it means they are prone to experiencing
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.100] its effects more readily or intensely, compared to others who may be less susceptible.
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.940] For example, due to her weakened immune system, she has a higher susceptibility to
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.720] catching colds during the winter months.
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.480] Another example is that children are often more susceptible to peer pressure during their teenage years.
