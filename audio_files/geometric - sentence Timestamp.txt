[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000] One, relating to geometry or characterized by shapes and figures,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000] refers to anything involving the principles, shapes, or properties of geometry,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000] such as lines, angles, circles, and polygons.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000] Example, the artist painting featured bold geometric patterns.
