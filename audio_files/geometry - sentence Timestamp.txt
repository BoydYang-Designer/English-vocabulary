[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400] Geometry is a noun with the following meanings.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.600] One, a branch of mathematics concerned with shapes, sizes, and properties of space
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.300] refers to the study of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids as well as their relationships, measurements, and properties.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.500] Example, in geometry class, we learned how to calculate the area of a circle.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.500] Example, the principles of geometry are applied in architecture and engineering.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:34.900] Two, the shape reform of a specific object or figure refers to the arrangement or structure of objects often related to their spatial relationships.
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.800] Example, the geometry of the building's design allows for maximum light exposure.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.500] Example, the bike's geometry affects its comfort and performance during rides, summary.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.700] Geometry refers to both a field of mathematics that studies spatial relationships and the shape or arrangement of physical objects.
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.100] Related words, shapes, figures, mathematics, structure form.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.600] Antonyms, none specific, but unrelated subjects could include non-mathematical fields such as literature or history.
