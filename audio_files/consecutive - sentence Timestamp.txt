[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560] Consecutive is an adjective that means following one after another in order, but with the possibility
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.120] of breaks or pauses between events.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.640] The key feature is the sequence, not necessarily the absence of interruptions.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.120] Example sentences.

[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.880] Comparison with Continuous.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.240] Continuous, which means something happens without interruption, consecutive refers to events
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.120] or actions occurring one after the other in order, but not necessarily without breaks.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.040] For example, working three consecutive nights means you work three nights in a row, but
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.080] there were breaks between the shifts.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.000] In contrast, something continuous occurs without any interruptions, such as continuous
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.800] rain for 48 hours, meaning it never stopped raining.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.040] Summary, consecutive refers to things that happen in a sequential order one after another,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.520] but have pauses or gaps in between.
