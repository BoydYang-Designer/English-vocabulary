[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960] Consecutive is an adjective that means following one after another in order, but with the
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.440] possibility of breaks or pauses between events.
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.120] The key feature is the sequence, not necessarily the absence of interruptions.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.020] Example sentences.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.440] She worked three consecutive nights without a day off.

[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.580] Comparison with Continuous.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.920] Unlike Continuous, which means something happens without interruption, consecutive
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.180] refers to events or actions occurring one after the other in order,
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.420] but not necessarily without breaks.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.900] For example, working three consecutive nights means you worked three nights in a row, but there were breaks between
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.400] the shifts.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.440] In contrast, something Continuous occurs without any interruptions, such as
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.300] continuous rain for 48 hours,
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.360] meaning it never stopped raining.
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.060] Summary, consecutive, refers to things that happen in a sequential order one after another, but
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.260] have pauses or gaps in between.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.820] Continuous means happening without any interruption or break.
