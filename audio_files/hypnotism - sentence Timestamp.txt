[00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.660] Hypnotism is a technique where someone helps another person enter a very relaxed and
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.180] focused state, a bit like being in a daydream.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.660] In this state, the person might be more open to suggestions or instructions from the hypnotist.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.140] It's often used to help with things like breaking habits, managing pain, or
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.740] for entertainment.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.400] Example, the stage magician used hypnotism to make the volunteer forget their own name
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.160] during the performance.
