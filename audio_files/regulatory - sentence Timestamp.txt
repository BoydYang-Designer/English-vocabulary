[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860] Regulatory simply means having to do with rules or laws that control
[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.660] or guide how something is done.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.160] It's about making sure that people or organizations follow the right procedures or standards.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.440] For instance, in the food industry, there are regulations about hygiene and safety that restaurants
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.260] must follow.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.540] Similarly, financial markets have regulations to ensure fair trading practices.
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.420] So regulatory basically means overseeing and enforcing rules to ensure things are
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.760] done properly and fairly.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.900] 1.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.800] Example.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.920] The company's failure to comply with regulatory requirements resulted in legal action and reputational damage.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.140] 2.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.180] Example.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.640] The regulatory environment can have a significant impact on business operations and investment decisions.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.800] Example.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.380] Financial regulators monitor the stock market to detect and prevent insider trading.
