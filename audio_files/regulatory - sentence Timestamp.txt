[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000] Regulatory simply means having to do with rules or laws that control or guide how something is done.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.500] It's about making sure that people or organizations follow the right procedures or standards.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.500] For instance, in the food industry, there are regulations about hygiene and safety that restaurants must follow.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.000] Similarly, financial markets have regulations to ensure fair trading practices.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.500] So regulatory basically means overseeing and enforcing rules to ensure things are done properly and fairly.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.500] 1. Example. The company's failure to comply with regulatory requirements resulted in legal action and reputational damage.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.500] 2. Example. The regulatory environment can have a significant impact on business operations and investment decisions.
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.000] Example. Financial regulators monitor the stock market to detect and prevent insider trading.
