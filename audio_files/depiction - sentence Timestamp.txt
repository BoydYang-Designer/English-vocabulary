[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000] Depiction refers to the representation or portrayal of something, typically
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.600] through visual or verbal means.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.600] It involves describing or showing something in a particular way to convey its characteristics or features.
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.340] While depiction and description both involve portraying something,
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.940] description typically refers to verbal or written portrayal, while depiction can encompass
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.620] a broader range of artistic or creative representations.
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.300] For example,
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.760] the artist's depiction of the historical event in her painting captured the emotions and
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.280] atmosphere of the moment.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.520] Another example is the storyteller's vivid depiction of the ancient battle transported the
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.260] audience back in time, as they could almost hear the clash of swords and the roar
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.040] of warriors.
