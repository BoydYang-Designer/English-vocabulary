[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360] 1. A skein typically refers to a length of yarn or thread that has been wound into a loose coil or loop.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.040] It's a standard unit of measurement for yarn and is commonly used in the textile and crafting industries.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.440] Scains are often sold as individual units and can vary in size depending on the amount of yarn they contain.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.240] Example, she bought a colorful skein of yarn to knit a scarf for her friend.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.880] 2. Scain can also refer to a tangled or complicated situation, often used metaphorically to describe
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.280] something complex or intricate. For example, you might hear someone refer to a skein of lies to describe
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.480] a complicated web of deceit. Example, the investigation into the crime turned into a tangled
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.080] skein of conflicting evidence. Another example, sorting through the tangled skein of paperwork on
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:57.520] my desk was like trying to unravel a knot of string.
