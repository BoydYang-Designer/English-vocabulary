[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420] Meander shares similarities with wander, but often implies a more leisurely and indirect path.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.920] It's derived from the winding course of the Meander River in Turkey, which twists and turns rather
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.760] than flowing straight.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.440] So when something meanders, it follows a winding or curving path, often without a clear
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.660] destination or purpose.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.660] It can describe both physical movement, like a river meandering through a landscape,
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.360] and metaphorical movement, such as thoughts or conversations that follow a winding or
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.140] circuitous route.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.260] For example, the trail meanders along the edge of the forest, leading us to a hidden lake.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.940] Similarly, his conversation always meanders, making it hard to predict what he'll say next.
