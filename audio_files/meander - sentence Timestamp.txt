[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000] Meander shares similarities with wander, but often implies a more leisurely and indirect path.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000] It's derived from the winding course of the Meander River in Turkey, which twists and turns rather than flowing straight.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000] So when something meanders, it follows a winding or curving path, often without a clear destination or purpose.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000] It can describe both physical movement, like a river meandering through a landscape, and metaphorical movement, such as thoughts or conversations that follow a winding or circuitous route.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000] For example, the trail meanders along the edge of the forest, leading us to a hidden lake.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000] Similarly, his conversation always meanders, making it hard to predict what he'll say next.
