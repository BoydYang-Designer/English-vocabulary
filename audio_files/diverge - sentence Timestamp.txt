[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820] Diverge as a verb, diverge, diverged, diverging.
[00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.420] Diverge typically means to separate and move in different directions from a common point or path.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.600] It can be used both literally, such as when roads or paths split into different directions,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.940] and metaphorically to describe ideas, opinions, or paths of development that move apart from each other.
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.120] For example, the hiking trail diverged into two paths, like one leading
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.420] towards the mountain peak and the other descending into the valley.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.780] The two friends' career paths began to diverge after college, with one pursuing a
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.660] traditional corporate job and the other opting for entrepreneurship.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.200] During the project development, the project members and the manager had diverging opinions on the
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.000] design direction.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.100] It's common for project members to diverge on the development direction,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.540] whether from a design perspective or a mechanical point of view.
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.280] However, in the end, they often converge on the best solutions for the project
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.620] and proceed accordingly.
