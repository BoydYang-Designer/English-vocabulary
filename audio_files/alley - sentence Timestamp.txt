[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620] An alley is a narrow street or passageway, often located between
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.880] or behind buildings.
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.660] Allies are typically used for access to the back of buildings for services such as garbage collection
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.600] or deliveries or as shortcuts between streets.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.360] They can vary in size and appearance, ranging from small pedestrian walkways to larger
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.980] lanes that allow vehicular traffic.
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.820] In urban areas, alleys are common features of the cityscape and serve various practical purposes.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.100] Additionally,
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.700] alleys can sometimes have a reputation for being dimly lit or less frequented, making them associated
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.140] with certain activities or subcultures.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.000] For example, I always take the alley behind the coffee shop to get to work faster.
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.760] The detective cautiously entered the dimly lit alley, knowing it was a common spot for illicit deals.
