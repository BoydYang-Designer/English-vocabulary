[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980] Aerodynamic is an adjective that refers to designed or shape to reduce
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.780] air resistance and increase efficiency.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.940] It refers to objects or designs that are streamlined to move smoothly through air,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.080] often for the purpose of improving speed or fuel efficiency.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.160] Example, the car's aerodynamic shape reduces drag and improves fuel economy.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.240] Example, the athlete wore an aerodynamic suit to enhance performance.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.200] Example, the new bike has an aerodynamic frame for better speed.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.980] Summary, aerodynamic describes shapes or designs that minimize air resistance to improve efficiency,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.260] speed or performance.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.760] Related words, streamlined, sleek, efficient, fluid, smooth.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.980] Antoninms, bulky, inefficient, clunky, un -streamlined.
