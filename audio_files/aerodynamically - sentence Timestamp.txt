[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500] Aerodynamically is an adverb that relates to the study or design of the flow of air around objects, especially vehicles, to reduce drag and improve efficiency.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.000] Example, the car was designed with smooth curves and a sloping roofline to improve its aerodynamics, allowing it to achieve higher speeds with less fuel consumption.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.500] Example, the bicycle trailer was aerodynamically shaped to reduce drag and increase stability on the road.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.500] Summary, aerodynamically refers to the design or modification of an object to minimize air resistance, often for better performance or efficiency in movement through the air.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.500] Related words, efficiently, streamlined, optimized, Antonim's, inefficiently, drag-inducing, unoptimized.
