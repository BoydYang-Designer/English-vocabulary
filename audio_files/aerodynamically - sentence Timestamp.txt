[00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.200] Aerodynamically is an adverb that relates to the study or design of the flow of air around objects,
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.020] especially vehicles, to reduce drag and improve efficiency.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.320] Example,
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.380] the car was designed with smooth curves and a sloping roofline to improve its aerodynamics,
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.760] allowing it to achieve higher speeds with less fuel consumption.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.640] Example, the bicycle trailer was aerodynamically shaped to reduce drag and increase
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.740] stability on the road.
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.960] Summary, aerodynamically, refers to the design or modification of an object to minimize
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.280] air resistance, often for better performance or efficiency in movement through the air.
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.060] Related words, efficiently,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.020] streamlined,
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.160] optimized, antonyms, inefficiently, drag inducing, unoptimized.
