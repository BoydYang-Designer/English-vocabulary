[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920] Fossilization is a noun that refers to the process through which organic material, such as plants or animals,
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.000] is preserved as fossils over long periods.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000] This process involves the replacement of original materials with minerals,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000] typically occurring in sedimentary environments where organisms are buried quickly and protected from decay.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.800] Meaning, one, the process of turning into a fossil,
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.360] this describes how remains are preserved through mineralization and other geological processes.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.000] Example, fossilization can take thousands to millions of years, depending on the conditions present.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.000] Example, the fossilization of ancient fish provided valuable insights into prehistoric marine life.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.320] Two, becoming outdated or unchanging.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.920] It can also refer to the figurative idea of practices or ideas becoming stagnant or obsolete over time.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.080] The fossilization of outdated policies can hinder an organization's ability to innovate.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.320] Example, if educational methods undergo fossilization they may no longer meet the needs of modern students.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.800] Summary, fossilization describes both the scientific process of preserving organic remains as
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.040] fossils and the metaphorical idea of becoming stagnant or outdated.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.640] Related words, preservation, mineralization, petrification,
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.680] antinims, adaptation, evolution, change.
