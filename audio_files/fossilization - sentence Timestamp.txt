[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860] Fossilization is a noun that refers to the process through which organic
[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.440] materials such as plants or animals is preserved as fossils over long periods.
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.900] This process involves the replacement of original materials with minerals, typically occurring
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.500] in sedimentary environments where organisms are buried quickly and protected from decay.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.160] Meanings.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.120] One, the process of turning into a fossil.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.220] This describes how remains are preserved through mineralization and other geological processes.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.940] Example, fossilization can take thousands to millions of years depending on the conditions present.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.120] Example, the fossilization of ancient fish provided valuable insights into prehistoric marine life.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.000] Two, becoming outdated or unchanging.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.220] It can also refer to the figurative idea of practices or ideas becoming stagnant or obsolete
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.940] over time.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.000] The fossilization of outdated policies can hinder an organization's ability to innovate.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.880] Example, if educational methods undergo fossilization they may no longer
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.400] meet the needs of modern students.
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.260] Summary, fossilization describes both the scientific process of preserving organic
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.700] remains as fossils and the metaphorical idea of becoming stagnant or outdated.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.280] Related words, preservation,
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.500] mineralization, petrification,
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.560] antonyms, adaptation,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.400] evolution, change.
