[00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.480] Perspective refers to a particular way of viewing things or understanding situations, often
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.060] shaped by one's beliefs, experiences, and attitudes.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.360] It's like putting on a pair of glasses that color how you view the world.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.080] Your perspective is influenced by your experiences, beliefs, and feelings.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.620] Just as different glasses can give you different views, different perspectives can give you different
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.320] understandings of the same thing.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.200] It's what makes people unique and can lead to different opinions or interpretations
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.020] of events.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.100] For example,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.780] from her perspective,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.400] the situation seemed entirely different.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.420] Another example is in product design.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.300] Taking into account the ergonomic perspective ensures that the product is comfortable and
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.300] easy to use for the intended users.
