[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040] A whistleblower is an individual who exposes or brings to light information about illegal,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.380] unethical, or wrongful activities occurring within an organization or government.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.320] Whistleblowers often do so by reporting the misconduct to authorities, regulatory agencies,
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.880] the media, or other relevant parties.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.920] They play a crucial role in promoting transparency, accountability, and integrity, but they may
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.600] also face risks such as retaliation, harassment, or legal consequences for their actions.
