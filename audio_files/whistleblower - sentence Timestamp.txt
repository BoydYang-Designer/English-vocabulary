[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.400] A whistleblower is an individual who exposes or brings to light information
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.140] about illegal, unethical, or wrongful activities occurring within an
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.340] organization or government.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.660] Whistleblowers often do so by reporting the misconduct to authorities, regulatory agencies,
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.920] the media, or other relevant parties.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.660] They play a crucial role in promoting transparency, accountability, and integrity, but
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.520] they may also face risks such as retaliation, harassment, or legal consequences
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.360] for their actions.
