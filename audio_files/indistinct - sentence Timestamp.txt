[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.280] or distinguish.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.000] The painting was so abstract that the shapes and colors appear indistinct, leaving viewers
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.640] to interpret its meaning for themselves.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.400] Your voice was indistinct.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.320] Could you please repeat that again?
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.120] The presenter's slides were poorly organized and their explanations were often indistinct,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.120] leaving the audience confused about the main points of the presentation.
