[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160] Robustness is a noun that refers to the quality of being strong, durable,
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.140] resilient, or able to endure and perform well under stress or changing conditions.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.680] It describes the ability of something, whether a system, structure, or organism, to maintain strength, stability,
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.280] or performance over time, even in challenging circumstances.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.880] Example, the robustness of the new software system ensured it could handle high traffic
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.260] volumes without crashing.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.000] Example, the robustness of the bridge design allows it to withstand extreme weather conditions.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.020] Example, the robustness of the ecosystem allowed it to recover quickly after the forest fire.
