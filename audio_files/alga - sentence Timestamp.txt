[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.760] Example. The research focused on the properties of a particular alga used in biofuel production.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.000] Summary. Alga refers to a single organism from the group of simple photosynthetic organisms
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.240] known as algae, typically found in aquatic or damp environments, related words, algae, plankton,
