[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140] Celsius is a noun and an adjective that refers to a scale for measuring temperature, where
[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.180] zero degree cells represents the freezing point of water, and 100 degree Celsius represents
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.860] the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.660] The Celsius scale is commonly used around the world, especially in scientific contexts.
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.660] Example, the temperature outside was a chilly 5 degree Celsius, so we decided to wear jackets.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.800] Example, the scientist recorded the experiment at a constant temperature of 25 degrees
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.440] Celsius Celsius.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.040] Example, the weather report predicted a high of 30 degrees Celsius tomorrow, perfect for
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.440] a day at the beach.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.140] Summary, Celsius is a temperature scale used to measure heat or cold, with zero degree
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.320] Celsius as the freezing point of water and 100 degree Celsius as the boiling point.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.080] Related words, temperature, scale, thermometer, degree.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.560] Antonyms, Fahrenheit, a different temperature scale.
