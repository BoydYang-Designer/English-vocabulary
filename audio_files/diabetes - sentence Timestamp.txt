[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.880] sugar, glucose levels due to the body's inability to produce enough insulin or to effectively
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.200] use the insulin it produces.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.840] There are two main types of diabetes.

[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.880] leading to little or no insulin production.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.120] This type usually develops in children and young adults.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.840] Example, he was diagnosed with type one diabetes at a young age and requires insulin injections

[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.560] factors.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.040] Example, many people with type two diabetes can manage their condition through diet and

[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.280] glucose, leading to elevated blood sugar levels, which can result in various health complications
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.680] if not managed properly.
