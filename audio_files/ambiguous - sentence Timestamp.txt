[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000] Ambiguous means having more than one possible interpretation or meaning, often due to being
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.400] unclear, vague, or open to different interpretations.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.240] For example, the statement was intentionally ambiguous, leaving room for various interpretations.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.080] Another example is he felt that his role in the company was becoming more ambiguous,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080] uncertain.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.160] Additionally, due to the ambiguous nature of the question, it was difficult to choose
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800] the right answer.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.120] Moreover, his answers were worded ambiguously, so no one could be sure what he meant,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.640] as an adverb ambiguously.
