[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680] One, precise is something that is exact, accurate, or clearly defined without any ambiguity
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.080] or vagueness.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.080] It implies a high level of accuracy or specificity.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.080] For example, the architect provided precise measurements for the construction of the building
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.040] to ensure it meets safety regulations.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.680] Two, precise refers to an exact and particular time, location, or any specific detail, always
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.560] used before a noun.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.800] For example, the meeting will start at 9 a.m. precise, so please be punctual.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.760] Another example is she quietly closed the door to the baby's room, and at just that precise
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.360] moment, the phone began to ring.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.440] Three, precise can also be used to describe someone who is very careful and exact about
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.320] the details of something, suggesting a meticulous or thorough approach.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.640] For instance, she is very precise in her work.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.640] Precisely functions as an adverb.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.120] For example, it is precisely exactly to a clock.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.440] Another example is she knows precisely how much money he has.
