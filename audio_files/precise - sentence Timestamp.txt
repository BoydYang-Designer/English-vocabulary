[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.200] One,
[00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.580] precise is something that is exact, accurate, or clearly defined without any ambiguity
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.440] or vagueness.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.500] It implies a high level of accuracy or specificity.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.960] For example, the architect provided precise measurements for the construction of the building to ensure it meets
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.880] safety regulations.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.680] Two, precise refers to an exact and particular time, location, or any specific
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.700] detail always used before a noun.
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.020] For example,
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.320] the meeting will start at 9 a .m.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.160] precise, so please be punctual.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.080] Another example is she quietly closed the door to the baby's room, and at just
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.500] that precise moment, the phone began to ring.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.400] Three, precise can also be used to describe someone who is very careful and exact about
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.740] the details of something, suggesting a meticulous or thorough approach.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.500] For instance, she is very precise in her work.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.020] Precisely functions as an adverb.
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.700] For example, it is precisely exactly two o 'clock.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.140] Another example is he knows precisely how much money he has.
