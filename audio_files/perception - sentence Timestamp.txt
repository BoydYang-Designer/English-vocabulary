[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920] Perception refers to the way in which we interpret and understand sensory information
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.100] from the environment.
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.640] It involves the process of organizing, interpreting, and making sense of incoming sensory
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.160] data in order to understand the world around us.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.660] Perception can be influenced by factors such as our past experiences, cultural background, beliefs,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.920] and expectations.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.600] Example one, our perception of a situation can greatly affect how we respond to it.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.200] Example two,
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.560] my perception of the problem is quite different.
