[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820] encroachment is like slowly moving into someone else's area or space without them
[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.820] wanting you there.
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.100] For example, the encroachment of urban development into rural areas threatens the natural
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.820] landscape and wildlife habitats.
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.620] For example, I'm becoming increasingly frustrated by the encroachments on my personal space in
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.540] the crowded subway during rush hour.
