[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000] Frozen shoulder is a condition characterized by stiffness, pain, and
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.960] limited range of motion in the shoulder joint.
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.220] It occurs when the connective tissue surrounding the shoulder joint thickens and tightens,
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.580] leading to inflammation and restriction of movement.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.900] Example,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.480] she was diagnosed with frozen shoulder after experiencing persistent pain and difficulty raising
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.040] her arm.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.200] Example, physical therapy is often recommended to help improve mobility
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.540] in patients with frozen shoulder.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.680] Example, the symptoms of frozen shoulder can take months or even years to resolve completely.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.700] Example, treatment options for frozen shoulder may include pain management, stretching exercises,
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.800] and sometimes injections.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.480] Summary, frozen shoulder is a painful condition that results in limited movement of the shoulder
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.420] joint due to inflammation and thickening of the surrounding connective tissue.
