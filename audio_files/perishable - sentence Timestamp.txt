[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880] Parishable refers to something that is likely to decay, spoil, or become unusable over time,
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.720] typically due to its organic nature or sensitivity to external conditions such as temperature, humidity, or exposure to air.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.120] Parishable items include food, plants, and other organic materials that have a limited shelf life
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.000] and must be consumed or used within a certain time frame to avoid spoilage.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.240] These items may deteriorate quickly if not stored or handled properly.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.040] For example, perishable goods such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products need to be stored in refrigerated conditions to prevent spoilage.
