[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900] Perishable refers to something that is likely to decay, spoil, or become unusable
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.820] over time, typically due to its organic nature or sensitivity to external conditions
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.300] such as temperature, humidity, or exposure to air.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.840] Perishable items include food, plants, and other organic materials that have a
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.800] limited shelf life and must be consumed or used within a certain time frame to
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.700] avoid spoilage.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.660] These items may deteriorate quickly if not stored or handled properly.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.120] For example,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.520] perishable goods such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products need to be stored in
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.760] refrigerated conditions to prevent spoilage.
