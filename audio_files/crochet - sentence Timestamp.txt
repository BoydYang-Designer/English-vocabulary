[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500] Crochet is a handicraft that involves creating fabric by interlocking loops of yarn or thread using a hooked needle.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.320] It's similar to knitting, but uses a single hook needle instead of two needles.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.460] Crochet can be used to make a wide range of items, including clothing, accessories, household items, and decorative pieces.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.400] For example, she spent her evenings crocheting a cozy blanket for her newborn niece.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.640] For example, the local crocheter displayed her beautifully crafted scarves and hats at the artisan market.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.240] For example, my grandmother taught me how to crochet, and now I'm making a colorful scarf for winter.
