[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000] Carbon is a chemical element that forms substances like diamonds and coal and is found in petroleum,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000] as well as in all living plants and animals.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000] It is a key component of organic compounds, making it essential for biological processes
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000] and widely used in industrial applications.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000] Additionally, in everyday language, carbon can refer to a carbon copy or duplicate of something, especially in documents.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000] Example sentences, carbon is a fundamental building block of organic molecules, such as proteins and DNA.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000] Diamonds and graphite are two distinct forms of carbon, with vastly different physical properties.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000] The increase in carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to climate change.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000] I want two carbons for our files to keep as duplicates of the original document.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000] Summary, carbon is a versatile chemical element, essential for life, present in various forms, and critical to both biological and industrial processes.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000] It can also refer to a duplicate or copy in certain contexts.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000] Related words, carbon dioxide, CO2, hydrocarbons, organic compounds, carbon emissions, carbon copy.
