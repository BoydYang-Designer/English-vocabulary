[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.540] marked with measurements in inches, feet, centimeters, or meters.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.420] It is commonly used for measuring lengths, widths, and distances.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.940] For example,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.100] can you pass me the tape measure?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.200] I need to check the dimensions of this piece of furniture before we start assembling it.
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.460] Another example is, could you please hand me the fabric tape measure?
