[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480] Woke culture refers to a social movement or cultural trend focused on awareness of social inequalities,
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.280] especially in relation to race, gender, and other identity groups.
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.800] It emphasizes the recognition of systemic oppression and social justice issues advocating
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800] for social change and inclusivity.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.500] Woke originally comes from African -American vernacular English, AAVE, and
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.540] referred to being alert to social injustices, particularly racial discrimination.
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.980] However, woke culture has been critiqued and sometimes used pejoratively,
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.400] particularly in discussions about political correctness or cancel culture,
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.920] where it can imply excessive or overly righteous attention to social issues.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.400] Example,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.720] some argue that woke culture sometimes goes too far in its pursuit of
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.460] social justice.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.000] Example, the rise of woke culture in recent years has sparked debates about free speech
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760] and the limits of political correctness.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.860] Example,
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.200] the company's adoption of woke culture led to changes in its policies, ensuring better
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.460] representation and inclusivity in their workforce.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.560] Summary, woke culture refers to a movement that highlights social justice, awareness of inequalities,
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.060] and systemic oppression, often advocating for inclusive and progressive changes in society.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.460] It can also be a point of controversy depending on how it is implemented and perceived.
