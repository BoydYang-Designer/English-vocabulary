[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360] Firmmentation is a noun, refers to the process by which yeast, bacteria, or other microorganisms
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.440] break down sugars into simpler compounds such as alcohol, gases, or acids, often resulting
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.600] in the production of alcohol or carbon dioxide.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.760] It is commonly used in food production, such as in bread making, brewing, and the production
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.240] of dairy products.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.120] Example, the fermentation of grapes produces wine and carbon dioxide.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.680] For example, the bacteria are responsible for the fermentation process in yogurt.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.360] Example, the fermentation of dough helps it rise before baking.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.920] Example, fermentation is a key step in the production of beer and spirits.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.000] Summary, fermentation is the chemical breakdown of substances, especially sugars by microorganisms,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.480] typically resulting in alcohol, gas, or acid production, and is essential in many food
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.240] and beverage processes.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.320] In other words, yeast, bacteria, brewing, ferment, microbial action, antinim's stability,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.720] preservation, non-fermentation.
