[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580] Fermentation is a noun, refers to the process by which yeast, bacteria,
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.140] or other microorganisms break down sugars into simpler compounds such as alcohol, gases,
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.480] or acids, often resulting in the production of alcohol or carbon dioxide.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.620] It is commonly used in food production, such as in bread making, brewing, and the production of dairy products.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.020] Example, the fermentation of grapes produces wine and carbon dioxide.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.560] Example, the bacteria are responsible for the fermentation process in yogurt.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.320] Example, the fermentation of dough helps it rise before baking.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.600] Example, fermentation is a key step in the production of beer and spirits.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.820] Summary, fermentation is the chemical breakdown of substances,
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.020] especially sugars by microorganisms, typically resulting in alcohol, gas, or
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.300] acid production, and is essential in many food and beverage processes.
