[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120] Suddly means in a delicate or nuanced manner, often with finesse or understatement.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.080] It implies a level of indirectness or delicacy in how something is done or communicated.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.840] For example, if someone subtly hints at a preference without directly stating it, they
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.400] are suggesting it in a subtle manner.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.640] Similarly, a subtle change in someone's behavior might be difficult to notice immediately
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.880] because it is done in an understated way.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.080] For instance, she subtly hinted at her displeasure with the decision, barely raising her voice,

[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.120] Or the designer subtly refined the product's shape, making slight adjustments to enhance
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.720] its functionality without significantly changing its appearance.
