[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000] Subtly means in a delicate or nuanced manner, often with finesse
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.980] or understatement.
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.280] It implies a level of indirectness or delicacy in how something is done or communicated.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.880] For example, if someone subtly hints at a preference without directly stating it, they are suggesting it in a
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.500] subtle manner.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.040] Similarly, a subtle change in someone's behavior might be difficult to notice
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.900] immediately because it is done in an understated way.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.540] For instance, she subtly hinted at her displeasure with the decision, barely raising her
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.660] voice but conveying her feelings through a slight frown and a hesitant tone.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.280] Or, the designer subtly refined the product's shape, making slight adjustments to enhance its
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.440] functionality without significantly changing its appearance.
