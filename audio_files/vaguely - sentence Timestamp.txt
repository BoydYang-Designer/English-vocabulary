[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180] Vaguely encompasses three meanings.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.940] One, somewhat or slightly, used to indicate a small degree or extent.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.380] There was something vaguely disturbing about the whole incident.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.660] We were vaguely aware of what was going on outside.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.880] She vaguely remembered meeting him at the party but couldn't recall any specific details.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.800] Two, in a way that is not clearly stated or expressed, indicating a lack of clarity
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.420] or precision.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.520] His instructions were vaguely worded, leaving me uncertain about what he wanted me to do.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.680] Three, in a way which shows that you are not paying attention, suggesting a lack of
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.880] focus or attention.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.060] She only nodded vaguely in reply to my question.
