[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.080] Example, combustion of fuel in an engine
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.920] provides power to the vehicle.

[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.560] Two, a chemical reaction, typically involving oxygen
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.040] that produces heat in sometimes light, often occurring
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.080] in engines or other energy generating systems.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.000] Example, combustion occurs in the engine cylinders
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.160] powering the car's movement.

[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.000] to produce heat for cooking.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.360] Three, a sudden or violent release of energy, figuratively,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.440] intense activity or emotion.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.760] Example, the debate sparked a combustion of ideas
