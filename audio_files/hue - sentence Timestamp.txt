[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340] Hugh refers to a specific shade or color,
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.320] particularly within the context of color theory.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.760] It represents one of the three characteristics of color
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.480] along with saturation and brightness.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.720] Essentially, Hugh distinguishes different colors
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.960] from one another on the color wheel.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.600] For example, red, blue, green, and yellow
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.960] are all different hues.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.240] The artist carefully selected the perfect hue of blue
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.920] for the sky in her painting.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.280] The decorator recommended a warmer hue of paint
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.040] for the living room walls to create a cozy atmosphere.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.720] The sunset painted the sky with hues of orange,
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.880] pink, and purple, creating a breathtaking scene.
