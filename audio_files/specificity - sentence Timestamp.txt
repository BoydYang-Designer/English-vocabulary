[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440] Specificity can be used as a noun.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.720] As a noun, specificity, one,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.360] the quality of being specific,
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.680] precise, or clearly defined.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.880] Examples, the specificity of her instructions
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.160] made the task easy to follow.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.720] Scientific experiments require high specificity
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.720] to obtain accurate results.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.440] The lawyer emphasized the specificity
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.720] of the contract terms.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.320] Two, the state of being particular
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.840] or detailed about something.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.760] Examples, the teacher praised the student
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.120] for the specificity in her essay.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.320] The report lacks specificity and needs more concrete examples.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.160] Specificity in communication helps avoid misunderstandings.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.760] Three, biology medicine.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.360] The ability of a test or substance
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.800] to target a particular organism, tissue, or molecule.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800] Examples, the test specificity ensures
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400] it detects only the intended virus.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400] High specificity in drugs reduces side effects.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.640] Researchers are working to improve
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.440] the specificity of the antibodies.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.080] Summary, specificity refers to the quality
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.120] of being precise, detailed, or clearly defined.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.240] And in scientific context,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.760] the ability to target a particular organism or element.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000] Synonym's precision, exactness,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.640] particularity, clarity, distinctness.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.840] Antonyms, vagueness, generality, ambiguity,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.600] imprecision, uncertainty.
