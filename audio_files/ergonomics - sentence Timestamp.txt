[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920] Ergonomics is a noun with the following meaning, the study or design of equipment, furniture,
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.560] or systems intended to maximize efficiency, comfort, and safety by promoting good posture
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.640] and reducing strain on the body.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.680] Ergonomics is often applied in the design of workspaces, tools, and equipment to improve
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.160] human well-being and performance.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.280] Example, the company hired an expert in ergonomics to redesign the office layout and improve
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.800] employee comfort.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.120] An ergonomics in a workstation setup can reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.080] Example, the strollers ergonomics are designed to make pushing easier on the user with adjustable
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.480] handles and a balanced frame.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.840] Summary, ergonomics refers to the science and practice of designing systems, tools, and
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.400] environments to improve human comfort and efficiency while minimizing physical strain or
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.040] injury.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.040] Good words, comfort, design, efficiency, human factors, and discomfort, strain, inefficiency.
