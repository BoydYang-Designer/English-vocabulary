[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840] One trajectory refers to the path followed by a projectile object in motion
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.900] or celestial body, such as a planet or comet in its orbit or a rocket,
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.000] as it moves through space under the influence of given forces.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.540] For example, the scientists calculated the trajectory of the rocket to ensure it would reach
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.840] its intended destination.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.380] For example, before falling into the hoop, the basketball traveled a perfect trajectory.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.280] Two, figurative abstract the course of events or changes that occur
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.960] over time.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.740] For example, her career trajectory has been impressive,
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.440] starting from an entry -level position to now managing a team.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.020] For example, despite initial setbacks, the company's trajectory toward success remains steady, driven
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.280] by innovative strategies and unwavering determination.
