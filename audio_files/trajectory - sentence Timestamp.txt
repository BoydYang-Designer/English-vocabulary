[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100] One trajectory refers to the path followed by a projectile object in motion or
[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.860] celestial body, such as a planet or comet in its orbit or a rocket, as it moves
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.120] through space under the influence of given forces. For example, the scientist
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.280] calculated the trajectory of the rocket to ensure it would reach its intended
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.400] destination. For example, before falling into the hoop, the basketball traveled a
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.840] perfect trajectory. Two, figurative abstract, the course of events or changes
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.840] that occur over time. For example, her career trajectory has been impressive,
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.640] starting from an entry-level position to now managing a team. For example,
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.140] despite initial setbacks, the company's trajectory toward success remains
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.360] steady, driven by innovative strategies and unwavering determination.
