[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500] Carbon emissions.
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.900] As a noun, it refers to the release of carbon compounds,
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.200] primarily carbon dioxide CO2 into the atmosphere,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200] usually as a result of human activities,
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.800] such as burning fossil fuels,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.700] deforestation, and industrial processes.
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.600] Example, carbon emissions from vehicles
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200] contribute significantly to air pollution.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.900] Example, governments are implementing policies
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.600] to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.000] Example, renewable energy sources
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000] like wind and solar can help lower carbon emissions.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.600] Example, industries are being urged to track and report
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.500] their carbon emissions to meet environmental goals.
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.700] Summary, carbon emissions refer to the release
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.700] of carbon-based gases, particularly CO2,
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.500] into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.100] and climate change.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.000] Related words, greenhouse gases, CO2, pollution,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000] climate change, carbon footprint, antinims, carbon reduction,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.800] carbon sequestration, emissions-free, clean energy.
