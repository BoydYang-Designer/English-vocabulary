[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800] Saturation refers to the state of being fully soaked, filled, or saturated with a
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.960] substance to the point where it cannot hold anymore.
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.500] It can also describe the point at which a particular condition, phenomenon, or market
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.060] is at its maximum capacity or intensity.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.680] 1.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.300] Color.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600] Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of a color.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.540] Fully saturated colors appear vivid and vibrant, while desaturated colors appear more muted or diluted.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.260] For example, the artist used highly saturated hues to create a bold and vibrant
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.080] painting that captured the attention of everyone in the gallery.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.240] 2.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.940] Marketing.
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.060] Saturation can refer to the point at which a market is fully penetrated with a product or service,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.120] meaning that further expansion may be difficult.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.140] For example, with the introduction of several new smartphone models in recent years,
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.580] the mobile phone market has reached saturation,
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.320] making it challenging for manufacturers to attract new customers.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.760] For example, given the saturation of the market with similar products, the design team
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.020] faces the challenge of creating a new compact stroller that stands out among the crowd.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.160] 3.
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.440] Saturation can describe the widespread presence or repetition of information, such as an
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.140] advertising or news coverage, to the point of oversaturation, where the audience
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.560] becomes desensitized.
[00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.100] For example,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.860] the constant coverage of the political scandal saturated the news cycle, leaving
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.380] little room for other important stories to be reported.
