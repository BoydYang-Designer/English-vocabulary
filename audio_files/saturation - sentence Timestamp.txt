[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000] Saturation refers to the state of being fully soaked, filled, or saturated with a substance to the point where it cannot hold anymore.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000] It can also describe the point at which a particular condition, phenomenon, or market is at its maximum capacity or intensity.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000] One, color, saturation refers to the intensity or purity of a color.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000] Fully saturated colors appear vivid and vibrant, while desaturated colors appear more muted or diluted.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000] For example, the artist used highly saturated hues to create a bold and vibrant painting that captured the attention of everyone in the gallery.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.000] Two, marketing. Saturation can refer to the point at which a market is fully penetrated with a product or service, meaning that further expansion may be difficult.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.000] For example, with the introduction of several new smartphone models in recent years, the mobile phone market has reached saturation, making it challenging for manufacturers to attract new customers.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000] For example, given the saturation of the market with similar products, the design team faces the challenge of creating a new compact stroller that stands out among the crowd.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:22.000] Three, media. Saturation can describe the widespread presence or repetition of information, such as an advertising or news coverage, to the point of oversaturation where the audience becomes desensitized.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000] For example, the constant coverage of the political scandal saturated the news cycle, leaving little room for other important stories to be reported.
