[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200] 1. A myth is a traditional story, often of unknown authorship that explains natural phenomena,
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.280] cultural practices, or the origins of a society. For example, creation myths are stories about
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.240] how people in the world were first created. For example, Cupid and Psyche is a well-known
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.780] myth from Roman mythology, depicting the love story between a mortal woman and the God
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.780] of love.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.680] 2. A myth can also refer to an idea or story that is believed by many people, but that
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.080] is not true. For example, I don't believe the myths and legends about or surrounding
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.080] this forest. For example, the myth that carrots improve your eyesight while widely believed
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.560] is not scientifically accurate.
